# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Project

This repository holds all the necessary files for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data".   
It contains:  
 * README.md: This file  
 * CodeBook.md: Description of variables and data   
 * run_analisys.R: R code performing the transformation  
 * tidy_data.txt: The result generated by the script  

The first part of the code check if one of the files needed exists in the working directory, and download it if it is not. 
The Data is put in the 'UCI HAR Dataset' directory, which contains the train and test directories with their respective files and four general files.

The script reads the data from both the train and the test, merges them and includes informations about the subject, the activity and the activity label.

The next part retrives only the variable about the mean('mean()') and standard  deviation('std()') of measurement.

Then it changes the names of the variables to a more convenient format, using some substitution to translate variables names to a more clear english

Finally it summarize the informations computing the average for each subject and activity. It then exports the result to the 'tidy_dataset' text file.
